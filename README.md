## Project Requirements
1. **Real-world relevance** – Your project must address a **practical AI problem**.  
2. **AI-Driven, Not Just Software Engineering** – This is not an app-building course.  
3. **Clear AI Problem Statement** – Define the AI challenge you’re solving.  
4. **Explain Learning Objectives** – Why AI is needed, what techniques are used, and how it's evaluated.  
5. **No Pure API Wrapping** – If using pre-trained models, demonstrate modifications and contributions.  
6. **Reproducibility & Documentation** – Code must be well-documented and understandable.  
7. **Ethical Considerations** – Address biases, risks, and responsible AI principles.  
8. **Evaluation Metrics** – Must include **accuracy, efficiency, or scalability measures**.
